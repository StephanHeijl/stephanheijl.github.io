                <h2>Leadership for engineers</h2>
                <p>In order to be better prepared for a career with decisionmaking responsibility, I elected to enroll in the Leadership for Engineers track at DelftX, an initiative by the Technische Universiteit Delft. While the courses do not offer actual leadership experience, they do offer a theoretical framework that will help me become more effective as a leader. All certificates in the program were achieved with 90%+ scores. </p>
