                    <p>A digital native at heart, with a penchant for machine learning and data science. I specialize in Artificial Intelligence applied to the world of bioinformatics.</p>
                    <p>I am a driven person with a wide range of interests, experience in public speaking and an entrepreneurial state of mind.</p>

                <h2>This is my portfolio.</h2>
                <p>I use this website to display my accomplishments and work. I am currently employed at <a href="/professional-bioprodict.html" title="Click here to view my accomplishments at Bio-Prodict.">Bio-Prodict B.V.</a>, but I am always looking to extend my professional network and explore new opportunities.</p>

                <h2>What can I do for you?</h2>
                <p>In short, I am a data scientist. I mangle datapoints into becoming information, and feed those into state of the art algorithms that will make intelligent predictions about situations you haven't seen before. Examples include:</p>
                <ul class="chevron-list">
                    <li>Creating expert protein analysis networks.</li>
                    <li>Predicting the effect of mutations in breast cancer genes with high accuracy.</li>
                    <li>Processing large amounts of scientific literature to produce advanced field specific language models.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I combine my expertise in AI with experience in front-end development and my ability to translate the needs of non-technical audiences into usable specifications. This is how I add value to the companies where I work.</p>
                <h2>Further information</h2>
                <p>The <a href="projects.html">Projects page</a> on this website contains an overview of my previous and current work, education and publications. Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> in any way you see fit. I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have and provide any references you may need. </p>
