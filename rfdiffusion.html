                        🤖 The Baker Lab, founded by Dr. David Baker at the University of Washington, has been a leader
                        in the structural biology space for over a decade. The lab has focused on developing novel
                        methods and technologies to answer fundamental questions in the structural biology field.
                        Specifically, the Baker Lab has focused on three main areas: protein structure prediction,
                        protein-protein docking, and protein-drug design.
                    </p>
                    <p> 🤖 In the field of protein structure prediction,
                        the Baker Lab has developed a suite of computational tools, such as Rosetta and FoldIt, to
                        predict the structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences. This work has enabled
                        researchers to better understand the functions of proteins and has led to the development of new
                        treatments for a range of diseases. The Baker Lab has also been involved in protein-protein
                        docking, which aims to predict how two proteins interact with each other. This work has been
                        used to better understand the mechanisms of protein-protein interactions and to design novel
                        proteins.
                    </p>
                    <p> 🤖 In the field of protein-drug design, the Baker Lab has developed a range of
                        computational methods to design small molecules that can bind to proteins and modulate their
                        activity. This work has been used to develop new drugs for a range of diseases, including cancer
                        and Alzheimer's Disease.

            <p>Protein structure prediction was, for a long time, a holy grail of structural biology. Solving how a
                specific sequence of amino acids would fold into a 3D structure is immensely difficult due to the number
                of degrees of freedom involved. Physically based folding solutions using molecular dynamics were able to
                approximate this process to some extent, but at the cost of enormous amounts of compute. Running a full
                physical simulation of every atom requires vast amounts of processing time, necessitating solutions like
                the massively distributed Folding@Home project. This distributed supercomputer achieved a total compute
                of over 2 exaflops in 2020. </p>
            <p>Since 2016, however, significant steps were being made in this space with the application of machine
                learning to the problem. The CASP competition, which had been running biannually for 13 iterations,
                finally saw improvement after a decade of relative stagnation. In 2018, Google’s DeepMind competed with
                their initial submission of AlphaFold<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="bot-tooltip-link"
                    data-target="alphafold" title="Click to find out more!">🤖💬</a>. This deep learning based system
                achieved a ~20% improvement over
                the next competitor. In 2020, AlphaFold2 swept the board with a 265% score improvement over the Baker Lab’s
                submission. <em>Following this, Science’s Robert F. Service <a
                        href="https://www.science.org/content/article/game-has-changed-ai-triumphs-solving-protein-structures">called</a>
                    protein structure prediction “Solved by
                    AI”</em>.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the frontiers are always shifting. With one problem solved, a multitude of new challenges
                rear their head, previously not even considered possible to tackle. The Baker Lab is back with a vengeance,
                applying their own in-house tech to revolutionize protein design in several novel ways.</p>

                        designed to predict the 3D structure of a protein based on its amino acid sequence. AlphaFold
                        uses deep learning and other artificial intelligence techniques to accurately predict protein
                        structures, which can help scientists better understand how proteins interact with each other
                        and in turn, open up new avenues of research into the prevention and treatment of diseases.
                        AlphaFold has already achieved remarkable success in the biennial Critical Assessment of
                        Structure Prediction (CASP) competition, outperforming all other competitors and taking the top

            <h2 id="diffusion">Diffusion</h2>
            <p>Diffusion models are a relatively new type of model that allow for the generation of complex outputs.
                Proposed in 2015 as a technique for generating images, these models took a back seat to the emerging GAN
                architecture. The latter employs two models that are alternately trained in an adversarial manner to
                generate images and discriminate images generated by the network from those in the training set. This
                approach was able to create quite realistic looking imagery (consider StyleGAN and
                thispersondoesnotexist.com), but training the GANs is challenging. Having tried to train these myself
                back in 2016, balancing the power of the generator and discriminator is important and the long training
                runs can be unstable. Nevertheless, GANs were able to produce convincing results and were even able to
                be conditioned into generating different classes and properties when specified.</p>
            <p>Diffusion models operate quite differently. Instead of attempting to generate an image on the first try,
                Diffusion models iteratively improve on a noisy image, denoising the input to some extent with each
                step. The denoising process can be guided by another neural network, like CLIP<a
                    href="javascript:void(0);" class="bot-tooltip-link" data-target="clip"
                    title="Click to find out more!">🤖💬</a>, in order to produce
                results in line with a textual description. The training process is more stable and conditioning is far
                more fine grained, allowing for a wider range of images that can be generated. </p>

                        developed by OpenAI, which uses a contrastive learning approach to learn a joint representation
                        of text and images. The model takes in pairs of text and images, and learns to map them to a
                        common joint representation. This joint representation is then used for downstream tasks such as
                        image captioning, question answering, and more. OpenAI CLIP has recently shown to outperform
                        existing pre-training models on several tasks.

            <p>Diffusion models reached public consciousness in April of 2022, with the release of DALL-E 2 by OpenAI.
                While the initial release of DALL-E used a VQGAN architecture, the second iteration was equipped with a
                diffusion based generator. Beta access was granted to select individuals in July, but alternative
                implementations of the technology began sprouting up even before that. Midjourney became accessible on
                July 12th and Stable Diffusion, a fully open source implementation was released in August. <em>The
                    release
                    of these models resulted in an outpouring of creativity, with over 5 million images recorded by
                    Stable
                    Diffusion search engine <a href="https://lexica.art">Lexica.art</a> as of September.</em> </p>
            <p>The general principle of iteratively updating some input to get better results wasn't exactly new in the
                machine learning structural biology space. AlphaFold implements this method as well in order to make
                fine grained updates to the output structure after first finding a good approximation using the multiple
                sequence alignment. It is even hypothesized that this recycling function is a good approximation of the
                energy function actually used for folding. This process was cited as an inspiration by the authors for
                the
                the RF<i>Diffusion</i> paper. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04119">Work on integrating diffusion

            <p>Using the RossettaFold protein folding model with a Diffusion approach allows them to specify some
                constraints, like a target protein to bind to, or a symmetry type, and generate a protein structure that
                satisfies those constraints. </p>
            <p>On December 10th 2022, David Juergens posted an update on Twitter. Reportedly their experimental results
                had come in, with 384 different designs straight out of the algorithm being tested for binding affinity.
                Conservatively, 18% of these 384 proteins showed binding responses of &lt;10μM, a two order of magnitude
                increase compared to previous Rosetta-based processes. All working proteins were shown to compete with a
                positive control, meaning that the designs likely targeted the intended region for binding.</p>

            <h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
            <p>In the RF<i>Diffusion</i> paper, the authors make use of an SE(3) equivariant diffusion model, referred
                to as
                DDPMs, to generate the backbone. Recent work has adapted these DDPMs for protein monomer design, with
                limited success. To address this, RosettaFold was used as a good candidate to improve on this, as it had
                already shown that it could design parts of protein backbones by doing inpainting of protein structures,
                which was then adapted to RFjoint Inpainting to design protein scaffolds in a single step. </p>
            <p>RosettaFold was finetuned as a denoiser. To train the model, a training set is generated by simulating
                the noising process for up to 200 steps on structures from the Protein Data Bank, with both the backbone
                and the residue orientation being perturbed. The Ca positions are translated randomly and residues are
                randomly rotated in a stepwise manner, and the model is trained to minimize mean squared error loss
                between predictions and the true structure. </p>
            <p>During inference, a random set of residues are generated and fed in RF<i>Diffusion</i> to denoise. The
                input for
                the next step is calculated by moving into the direction of the denoised step and adding some noise, to
                make sure that the denoising process mimics the initial noising process used for training. This is done
                iteratively until a protein-like structure is formed. When the backbone is designed, ProteinMPNN is used
                to predict a sequence that will translate into that backbone. The generated structure is then checked
                against the output of AlphaFold2 for the designed sequence. If the generated structure is close to the
                AF2 result, it is deemed a successful design <i>in silico</i>.</p>

            <h3 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h3>
            <p>RF<i>Diffusion</i> has turned out to be a powerful tool capable of designing protein structures with a
                variety
                of applications. It has the ability to generate monomers unconditionally, with little similarity to
                existing known protein structures. Generating a 100 residue structure takes approximately 2.5 minutes on
                an A4000 GPU (with time requirements likely scaling quadratically with sequence length). <i>In vitro</i>
                characterization of 11 TIM barrel designs indicated that nine designs aligned with expected protein
                parameters. </p>
            <p>It can also design higher order oligomers, which can serve as vaccine platforms, delivery vehicles and
                catalytic agents. The expected oligomerization pattern was found in ~16% of generated structures <i>in
                    vitro</i>. Additionally, it can design scaffolds for protein structural motifs used for binding and
                catalytic functions, with the constraint that the motif must retain its exact geometry for optimal
                performance. Out of 25 benchmark problems, RFDiffussion solves 23, 11 more than competitor
                “Hallucination”. No tuning was required. </p>
            <p>Lastly, it can be used to design de novo protein-binding proteins. Characterized as a grand challenge in
                protein design, RF<i>Diffusion</i> achieved an 18% success rate in designing protein binders.
                Experimental
                success rate compared to Rosetta-based methods ranges from 5x to 214x improvement depending on the
                target protein. RF<i>Diffusion</i> was finetuned on protein complexes in order to achieve this.</p>
            <h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
            <p>What is possible with this kind of model combined with its reported effectiveness is nearly endless. If
                these results hold up in practice, this could easily be the best application of diffusion models for
                mankind. It could share the crown for biggest advance in structural biology of this decade together with
                AlphaFold. </p>
            <p>Currently RF<i>Diffusion</i> is a potent method for the creation of protein-binders. Applications for
                this
                specifically are amazing in themselves, as it will allow for the rapid design and iteration of a myriad
                of drugs that target proteins specifically. Rapidly designing antibodies comes to mind immediately,
                provided that the technique proves robust for this notoriously hard to model protein type. Even without
                antibodies in play, developing inhibitors or activators for any number of proteins would be
                exponentially sped up by this innovation.</p>
            <p>Next steps are already being taken to incorporate nucleic acids into the model, allowing for DNA or RNA
                binding proteins to be designed rapidly. These types of drugs are used as <a
                    href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-03664-6"></a>anti-cancer
                agents</a> and could
                yield amazing results in that field.
            </p>
            <p>This is where my interpretation of future events starts. To me an obvious follow up would incorporate
                small molecules as opposed to just other proteins. Getting proteins that bind well to specific ligands
                is still an open problem. Generally, this process starts in nature, by trying to find a naturally
                occurring protein with a desired functionality that might bind to a desired substrate. While tools like
                Bio-Prodict’s <a href="https://3dm.bio-prodict.nl">3DM</a> were huge steps in making this process less
                arduous, it still requires human expertise.
                Next, the protein needs to be optimized. Nature’s best attempt for
                binding and/or converting a ligand of interest is likely not the best for industrial applications.
                Activity, specificity and stability are generally tuned for several rounds of guided evolution or
                (machine learning guided) rational design with the aim of getting several orders of magnitude increase
                in fit. These processes can take months and may not even yield a suitable design. If the high success
                rates reported for RF<i>Diffusion</i> hold up in this case, it would skip several steps in this process,
                lowering costs for designing custom proteins significantly.</p>
            <p>I project that RF<i>Diffusion</i> will first be enhanced by replacing the Rosetta protein folding module
                with a
                more capable model. This could be AlphaFold2 or one of the high performers in CASP15 (Baker
                unfortunately did not rank in the top 10 this year). The paper notes explicitly that this is possible for
                an array of different models. Sergey Ovchinikov already accomplished a hacked version of this on
                Twitter,
                less than a week after the initial pre-publication. Using AlphaFold2 as a design network may allow users
                to skip the AF2 validation step used by the authors for sequence verification. This is of course
                assuming that other models are not limited by lacking some of the design features RosettaFold exhibits.

            <p>Additional constraints outside a target protein could also be included. Guiding the diffusion process to
                produce structures more like a specific family of proteins would be a boon for enzyme design. Imagine
                specifying a target family of enzymes, a target ligand and letting the model rapidly design a protein
                that satisfies those constraints with high accuracy. Any number of pharmaceutical companies would be
                chomping at the bit to get access to this technology. RF<i>Diffusion</i> already is able to scaffold
                enzyme
                active sites without modeling small molecules explicitly. The authors demonstrate this capability in an
                experiment where they scaffold a retroaldolase active site.</p>
            <p>Finally and most futuristically, this process could be used to design complex biological machinery.
                Incorporating the functionality of the protein and modeling that in some manner would allow for the
                design of an entire pipeline of proteins that construct specific complex molecules. Adding search based
                optimization for known conversions with different protein families would usher in an era of rapid
                biological process design. Just enter a resource and target molecule, let the servers run for a bit and
                test the resulting pathway to find your required complex molecule being made in the lab! </p>

            <p>The Baker Lab has made significant strides in the space of protein design, with a great application of
                modern ML techniques combined with convincing experimental lab work. I trust that the very capable team
                is already working on developing this technique further, improving the accuracy and speed of this
                solution. In line with their previous projects, I expect that the source code for RF<i>Diffusion</i>
                will soon
                be published on GitHub under the BSD license. This will allow even more experimentation and innovative
                work to take place here. Given the pace at which advances take place in the Machine Learning/Protein
                space, I have no doubt that we are on the cusp of a decade of rapid innovation. This will lead to giant
                leaps in pharmaceutical and industrial applications of proteins, resulting in improved health care and
                vastly more green and efficient manufacturing processes.</p>
